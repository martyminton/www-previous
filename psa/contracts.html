We conduct high-touch engagements with ongoing senior management involvement to build and maintain long-term relationships. Federal agencies also have convenient access to PSA services via the following contract vehicles: GSA VETS, USN Seaport-e, DOLAR$ and NOAA IT BPA.</p> 

<p><strong>Our current contracts include:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transportation Security Administration (TSA).</strong> TSA’s Secure Flight program was developed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in response to a key 9/11 Commission recommendation. The program’s mission is to enhance the security of domestic and international commercial air travel through improved use of watch list matching. PSA provides highly experienced counterintelligence (CI) and counter terrorism (CT) analysts for evaluating passengers selected by the Secure Flight process.</p>

<p><strong>Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).</strong> The DIA’s Strategic Counterintelligence Directorate (SCID) mission is to identify, neutralize and exploit foreign intelligence and security services, terrorists, and insurgents targeting U.S. and Coalition interests. The PSA team directly supports and coordinates with the military services and other members of the CI and intelligence communities. Our analysts are located OCONUS in areas such as Afghanistan and Iraq, where their All Source, CI, and CT expertise best supports the mission of SCID.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Labor (DOL).</strong> The DOL’s Accounting and Related Systems (DOLAR$) is the Department’s current financial management system. PSA supports the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) under the guidance and direction of the Director of the Office of Financial Systems (OFS).

<p><strong>U.S. Marine Corps Forces - Special Operations Command (MARSOC).</strong> MARSOC RAVEN Deployment Certification Exercises (DCE) exercises are designed to test MARSOC skills in operating environments that are similar to those experienced on deployment.
