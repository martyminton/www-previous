	<p><span class="orange">Integrated Campaign</span> / For the National Guard, LMO must convey the truth of service and inspire everyday citizens to step into harm’s way. Who else does this? The Man of Steel™. LMO worked with Warner Bros. to marry the movie with the brand by creating "Soldier of Steel" and a campaign that coupled the theater spot with online initiatives, in-person events, social media, and custom fitness routines by leading man Henry Cavill. </p>
